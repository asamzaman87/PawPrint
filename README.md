# PawPrint
Random Assembly Design Project (Python, CSS, HTML)
● Worked on a team to create a trackable pet collar whose location could be accessed through a website and a phone
● Aided in the construction as well as assembly of the collar and created a website using basic HTML and CSS, which included an
embedded map, for the exact location of the collar
● Deployed a final product which was in the form of a wearable collar with an embedded systems component attached to it, as well as
a scannable QR code, for the pet’s tracking information
